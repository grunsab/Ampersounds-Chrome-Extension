## Installation (Developer Mode)

To install this extension in Chrome using developer mode, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/grunsab/Ampersounds-Chrome-Extension.git
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it to a folder on your computer.

2.  **Open Chrome Extensions Page:**
    *   Open Google Chrome.
    *   Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter.

3.  **Enable Developer Mode:**
    *   In the top right corner of the Extensions page, toggle the "Developer mode" switch to the ON position.

4.  **Load the Extension:**
    *   Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears on the left side of the page.
    *   In the file dialog that opens, navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the repository.
    *   Select the root folder of the project (the one containing the `manifest.json` file).
    *   Click "Select Folder" (or "Open").

5.  **Verify Installation:**
    *   The Lftovr extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions.
    *   Ensure the toggle switch next to the extension is enabled if you want it to be active.
